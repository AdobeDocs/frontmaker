# FrontMatters

FrontMatters is a CLI that lets you pick a front matter template to add to all your documentation markdown files. 
The front matter templates are named according to the Adobe product developer documentation they are used for. 
Each template can be customized and updated to represent the most accurate taxonomy (content categories) for their intended product.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your `<doc-project-root>` directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx https://github.com/AdobeDocs/frontmatters.git --ignore-existing
    ```

2. Answer the brief on-screen prompts.
