# FrontMaker

FrontMaker adds a front matter template block to your documentation markdown files. The front matter templates are defined by Adobe products. Each template can be customized and updated to evolve and represent the best taxonomy for a given product.

## Usage

Navigate to your `<product-documentation-root>` directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx https://github.com/AdobeDocs/frontmaker.git
```

Then follow the on-screen prompts.
